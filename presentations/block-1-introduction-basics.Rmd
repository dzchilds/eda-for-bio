## Before we start...

While we are wait for everyone to arrive and settle...

- Go to the APS 135 MOLE site and open today's lecture ("Block 1").

- Open up RStudio from the Programs Menu on your PC.

- Get your ucards out to be swiped. 

Grab a TA for help if you have a problem with any of these.

Course overview   
======================================================================================

## What are we aiming to do 

We have __three related aims__ in this course:

- Introduce specific tools (`dplyr` + `ggplot2`) to facilitate exploratory data analysis.
- Provide a foundation for using R next year to help you learn statistics. You will have to use it!
- Give you enough experience of basic R to start using it to Get Things Done, now next year, and beyond.

We could list a 4^th^ aim here as well. We hope that you will learn how to __help one another__ solve your R and data analysis problems. 

## Course structure {.build}

__Three blocks of related content__

- Introduction to R and Rstudio
- Data wrangling (`dplyr`)
- Exploratory data analysis (`ggplot2`) 

__Each block is 2 weeks long__

- Two 2-hour IT sessions
- Reading the [online course book](http://dzchilds.github.io/eda-for-bio/index.html) <-- take a quick look
- Lectures (sometimes!)

__Assessment__

- MOLE assessment in semester 2B (after Easter)

R and Rstudio | What are they? Why use them?
======================================================================================

## What is R? Why use R? {.build}

<div>
"R" is shorthand for "[GNU R](http://www.r-project.org)":

- An interactive programming language
- Focus on data analysis: data manipulation, data visualisation, and statistics
- This year is about the first two
</div>

<div>
"R" is also shorthand for the ecosystem around this language

- Ordinary useRs like me and you
- Bloggers
- Book authors
- Package developers
</div>

Learning to use R will make you __more efficient__ and facilitate use of __advanced data analysis tools__

## What is Rstudio {.build}

<div>
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment. Makes working with R much easier:

- Console to run R
- Editor to work with scripts 
- Package management
- Many more features...
</div>

<div class="red2"> Don't mix up R and RStudio. </div>

## Anatomy of RStudio {.build}

<div class="columns-2">

  <!-- <img src="../images/RStudio-3-pane.png" alt="RStudio" title="RStudio", width="450"> -->
  
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/RStudio-3-pane.png")
```
  
  What is in these three panes?
  
  #. Console
  #. Global Environment and History
  #. Everything else (e.g. file browser)
  
  Note: there is a 4^th^ pane that we will get to in a moment.

</div>

We will explore some of the core features of RStudio in this course. We are only going to scratch the surface of what RStudio can do, but we will cover enough for you to use it with confidence.

## Getting started {.build}

Let's get ready to use R and RStudio. Do the following:

  #. Open up RStudio `All Programs > RStudio`
  #. Maximise the RStudio window (always do this!)
  #. Click the Console pane
  #. Type `3 + 2` at the prompt `>`
  #. Hit Enter
  
What happened?

```{r}
3 + 2
```


Mathematical calculations | R is a big calculator
======================================================================================

## Arithmetic operations {.build}

<div>
You will not be surprised that R is very good at sums. It has all the arithmetic operators you would expect to see:

- `+`: addition 
- `-`: subtraction
- `*`: multiplication
- `/`: division
- `^`: exponentiation
</div>

<div>
__Remember__:

R does exponentiation first, multiplication and division next, and then addition and subtraction. If you need to change __the order of evaluation__ use parentheses --- `(` and `)` --- to group calculations.
</div>

## Exercise {.build}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Basic arithmetic__
<div id="box-text">
Do the following **in one step** in R:

1. Add the numbers 2 and 3
2. Multiple the resulting number by 2
3. Take the square of the second result.
</div>
</div>

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
((2 + 3) * 2) ^ 2
```
</div>

Now type the &#8593; key. What happened?

## Exercise {.build}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Combining calculations__
<div id="box-text">
Do you remember Pythagoras's theorem from school? It tells us how to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

Here's the formula:

$L_C = \sqrt(L_A^2 + L_B^2)$?

Use this to equation to calculate the length of the hypotenuse when $L_A = 2$ and $L_B = 3$. Make sure R does all the work for you.

Hint: Remember that the square root of a number $x$ is equal to $x^{1/2}$
</div>
</div>

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
(2^2 + 3^2)^(1/2)
```
</div>

## Assignment {.build}

<div>
We usually want to do more with R than just perform a few simple calculations. This means we need a way to store intermediate results. We do this with the assignment operator: `<-`. There will always be two parts to an assignment, sitting either side of the `<-`:

1. __Right hand side__: any valid R expression
2. __Left hand side__: the name to assign the result to
</div>

```{r}
x <- 3
x
```

In this example `x` is called the __name__. We have associated it with the __value__ 3.

## More assignment {.build}

```{r}
x <- 2
x
```
What happened to the old value of x?

```{r}
y <- x * 10^2
y
```

<div>
Once we have assigned a value a name we can reuse it. You can use the assignment operator with __any kind of object (a value)__ R knows how to make---not just numbers.
</div>

## Exercise {.build}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Using assignment__
<div id="box-text">
Let's look at the Pythagoras's theorem example again. 

1. Assign the value 2 to `a` and the value 3 to `b`.
2. Rewrite the calculation to find the length of the hypotenuse using `a` and `b`. 

Remember: $L_C = \sqrt(L_A^2 + L_B^2)$ 
</div>
</div>

```{r, include=show_ans}
a <- 2
b <- 3
(a^2 + b^2)^(1/2)
```


Using functions | Starting to make use of R's power 
======================================================================================

## Examples of using functions {.build .smaller}

<div>
An R function is similar to a mathematical function. It takes one or more inputs, does something to them and then returns the result to us. Here's a simple example:

```{r}
round(3.141593)
```

What did R do with this?
</div>

<div>
We can do the same thing a slightly more long-winded way like this:

```{r}
round(x = 3.141593)
```

Here, we specified the name of the input as `x` and we associated this with the value `3.141593`. You do not have to name inputs in R but it is a good habit to get into. You will see why later...
</div>

## Exercise {.build}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Using functions__
<div id="box-text">
Experiment with the following functions to convince yourself you know what they do:

- `sin`
- `log`
- `exp`
- `log10`
- `floor`
- `sinpi`

Hint --- don't just use whole numbers, i.e. make sure you try things like `floor(1.2)`
</div>
</div>

<!-- ## Exercise {.build .smaller} -->

<!-- <div id="exercise-box"> -->
<!-- __Using functions__ -->
<!-- <div id="box-text"> -->
<!-- We'll use a built in constant `pi` in this exercise. Type `pi` into the prompt and hit return. It's easy as $\pi$! We are going to round $\pi$ to 2 significant places. Experiment with the following uses of the `round` function. -->

<!-- - `round(x = pi, digits = 2)` -->
<!-- - `round(pi, digits = 2)` -->
<!-- - `round(x = pi, 2)` -->
<!-- - `round(pi, 2)` -->
<!-- - `round(digits = 2, x = pi)` -->
<!-- - `round(2, x = pi)` -->
<!-- - `round(digits = 2, pi)` -->
<!-- - `round(2, pi)` -->

<!-- Work out which ones give us the wrong answer. Can you see why? -->
<!-- </div> -->
<!-- </div> -->

## Functions {.build .smaller}

<div>
An R function takes one or more inputs, does something to them and then returns the result to us. In general, using a function looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_func_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```

__Details__

- `my_func_name`: the name of the function (e.g. `round`)
- `arg1`: name of the first __argument__
- `val1`: value of the first __argument__

A function may have 0, 1, or more name-value pairs. These are the inputs to the function. These inputs are called __arguments__.
</div>

<div>
Remember: 

1. Name on the left / Value of the right.
2. You do not have to name arguments but it is usually a good idea to do so.
</div>

Scripts | Reusing your hard work later
======================================================================================

## Working with a script

STEP 1: Do the following:

1. Navigate through RStudio's menus to `File > New File > R Script`.
2. A new pane should open up. Copy these calculations from earlier into your new script:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# short sides of the triangle
a <- 2
b <- 3
# length of the hypotenuse
(a^2 + b^2)^(1/2)
```
3. Now highlight those three lines and then hit `Ctrl+Enter`

What does the text in your script look like? What is the `#` symbol doing? What happened when you hit `Ctrl+Enter`? 

## Working with a script

<div>
STEP 2: Do the following:

1. Save your script using the familiar `File > Save` route.
2. Close the tab containing the script you just saved.
3. Close down RStudio (do not "save the workspace image""). 
4. Reopen RStudio and then open your script using `File > Open file...`
5. Now highlight those three lines and then hit `Ctrl+Enter`
</div>

You just made a script: a reusable computer program that you can share with collaborators and edit or extend as needed.

__This__ is why using R will save you time in the long run.


Vectors | The simplest objects in R
======================================================================================

## Vectors {.build .smaller}

Vectors are the simplest type of "object" in R. What are 'vectors'? They are ordered collections of simple things like numbers, characters, TRUE/FALSE values, etc. 

<div>
What does this print?
```{r}
print(5)
```
It prints a length-one **numeric** vector. 
</div>

<div>
What does this print?
```{r}
print("cat")
```
It prints a length-one **character** vector.
</div>

## Vectors {.build .smaller}

<div>
Vectors do a lot of work in R-land. There are many ways to make them. Let's look at what the `:` operator does:

```{r}
5:35
```
</div>

<div>
The `:` symbol makes a sequence of numbers. These are stored in a single vector with several __elements__.
<BR>
Questions:

-  What are the elements of the vector we made? 
-  How many elements are in the vector we made? 
-  What do the numbers in the square brackets `[ ]` signify?
</div>

<BR>
**Think of vectors as collections of simple things (e.g. numbers) that are ordered.**

## Vectors {.smaller}

We can manually create vectors from other vectors using the `c` function. The `c` function (__c__)ombines things together to make vectors.

Copy these lines of R code into your script and run them:

```{r}
# make a numeric vector
c(3, 4, 1:3)
# make a character vector
c("dog", "cat", "ape")
```

What colour are the words 'dog', 'cat' and 'ape' in your script? How does the colour compare to a number?

## Assignment (naming things) {.smaller}

Remember! --> we can use the assignment operator to associate a name with our vectors so that we can reuse them. Update your script and rerun the altered lines:

```{r}
# make a numeric vector and give it a name
my_num_vec <- c(3, 4, 1:3)
my_num_vec

# make a character vector and give it a name
my_chr_vec <- c("dog", "cat", "ape")
my_chr_vec
```

Now we have stored a numeric vector called `my_num_vec` and a character vector called `my_chr_vec`. 

Take a look in the environment tab (top right). Do the lines associated with `my_num_vec` make any sense `my_chr_vec`?

## Exercise {.build .smaller}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Different kinds of vectors__
<div id="box-text">

Use the `c` function to combine `my_num_vec` with `my_chr_vec`. There's no need to give the result a name. Just print the result to the Console. 

What happens? What kind of vector does this produce? Is it numeric or character?
</div>
</div>

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
# 'c'ombine my_num_vec and my_chr_vec
c(my_num_vec, my_chr_vec)
```

The resulting length-six vector is a character vector, i.e. R converted the numeric vector to character vector.

The lesson: __all the elements in a vector must be of the same type__. We are not allowed to mix and match numbers and characters.
</div>

## Extracting elements of vectors {.build}

R has a few built in vectors that we can access all the time. We just have to know their name. One of these is called `LETTERS`. What does it contain?

```{r}
LETTERS
```

How do we extract the letter `D`? This is the third element of the vector:

```{r}
LETTERS[4]
```

__Use the square brackets to subset vectors__. Notice that all we did was make a new vector of length one (there is nothing simpler than a vector).

## Extracting elements of vectors {.build}

What do we do if we need more than one element? Here is how to get elements in position 3 through to 10:

```{r}
LETTERS[3:10]
```

Remember what the `:` operator does? Take a look:

```{r}
3:10
```

Can you see how `LETTERS[3:10]` works now?

## Exercise {.build}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Extracting elements ("subsetting") vectors__
<div id="box-text">
See if you can extract a vector with the sequence of letters `C`, `E` and `J` from `LETTERS` 

Hint -->

- You will need the `c` function
- and the square brackets, `[ ]`.

</div>
</div>

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
LETTERS[c(3, 5, 10)]
```
</div>

## Exercise {.build}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Extracting elements from a vector__
<div id="box-text">

Create a vector containing the letters of the alphabet in reverse order. 

If that's easy, try this as well. See if you can work out how to extract the last element `LETTERS` without using `LETTERS[26]`. How could you do it? You'll need to guess the name of a function to extract the length of a vector.

</div>
</div>

```{r, include=show_ans}
LETTERS[26:1]
```

## Exercise

```{r, include=show_ans}
length(LETTERS)
LETTERS[length(LETTERS)]
```

This is a simple example of how we can generalise a task using a programming like R. 

## Vectorised operations {.build .small}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Vectorised operations__
<div id="box-text">
Make a vector containing elements in a sequence from 10 to 20 (use the `:` operator). Now add the number 2 to that vector.

Do you understand what happened?
</div>
</div>

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
myvec <- 10:20
myvec + 2
```
</div>

__Arithmetic operations are vectorised__

## Exercise {.build .smaller}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Vectorised operations__
<div id="box-text">
Use the `c` function to make a pair of numeric vectors containing the two following sets of numbers:

- 7, 2, 5, 3, 1   
- 1, 4, 8, 3, 9

Assign them the names `A` and `B`. Write some R code to determine the result of:

- `A + B`
- `A + B + 6`. 

Look carefully at the results. What happens when we add two numeric vectors together? What happens when we add a single number to a vector? 

Now make a new numeric vector containing the following set of numbers (call it `X`):

- 1, 2

Add this to the `A` vector. What happens when you add numeric vectors with different lengths?
</div>
</div>


## Exercise {.build}

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
# make `A`
A <- c(7, 2, 5, 3, 1)
A
# make `B`
B <- c(1, 4, 8, 3, 9)
B
```
</div>

## Exercise {.build}

<div>
```{r, include = show_ans}
A + B
A + B + 6
```
</div>

```{r, include = show_ans}
X <- 1:2
A + X
```

One last bit of the basics... | Logical comparisons
====================================================================

## Comparing vectors

We use __relational operators__ to compare the elements of numeric vectors:

- `x < y `: is x less than y?
- `x > y `: is x greater than y?
- `x <= y`: is x less than or equal to y?
- `x >= y`: is x greater than or equal to y?
- `x == y`: is x equal to y?
- `x != y`: is x not equal to y?

These operators produce something called a __logical vector__ (a vector of TRUE and FALSE values---nothing else allowed)

## Exercise {.build}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Using relational operators__
<div id="box-text">
Make two vectors named `num1` and `num2`, where `num1` is a sequence from 0 to 20, and `num2` is a sequence from 25 to 5. Once you have made these print them to screen, then experiment with `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==` and `!=` to convince yourself you understand how they work.
</div>
</div>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
num1 <- 0:20
num2 <- 5:25
```

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
num1
num2

```
</div>

## Exercise {.build .smaller}

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
num1
num2
```
</div>

```{r, include=show_ans}
num1 == num2
num1 != num2
```

## Exercise {.build  .smaller}

<div>
```{r, include=show_ans}
num1
num2
```
</div>

```{r, include=show_ans}
num1 <  num2
num1 <= num2
```

<!-- ## Combining comparisons {.build .smaller} -->

<!-- <div> -->
<!-- We use __logical operators__ to combine logical statements: -->

<!-- - `!x `: __negation__ = `TRUE` becomes `FALSE`, `FALSE` becomes `TRUE` -->

<!-- - `x | y`: __OR__  = `TRUE` if __either__ x and y are `TRUE`, `FALSE` otherwise -->

<!-- These operators produce another __logical vector__ (a vector of TRUE / FALSE values) -->

<!-- </div> -->

R packages | A great source of confusion 
====================================================================

## A (very) quick overview {.build}

<div>
Packages extend what base R can do. Two things have to happen before you can use a package:

1. You have to **install** it. This is a "do once" operation. After a package is installed you can close down and reopen R and it is still installed.

2. You have to **load and attach** it. This is a "do every time" operation. You have to load and attach the package every time you start a new session (= open R).
</div>

<hr>

<div>
A mobile phone App analogy: 

- installing a package <=> getting an App from an App store

- loading and attaching a package <=> opening the App on your phone
</div>

## How do we access packages?

1. We **install** a package with the `install.packages` function

2. We **load and attach** an installed package with the `library` function

**TIPS**

- Do not use `install.packages` inside your scripts! You don't want to reinstall a package every time you plan to use it. 

- You can also install a package via the Packages tab in RStudio. It is fine to use this if you don't like using `install.packages`.

## Loading and installing packages {.build}

<div>
We want to use the `fortune` function (singular) that resides in the **fortunes** package (plural). 

Do the following, in the order given, working directly in the Console. 

1. Try to use the `fortune` function, i.e. type `fortune()` straight into the Console.

2. Try to use `library` to load and attach the **fortunes** package. 

**Go slowly**. At each step, ask yourself, does this work or do I get an error? If there is an error, why?
</div>

<div>
Why doesn't this work? 

Look in the **Packages** tab in RStudio. Can you see anything called fortunes? No! The package hasn't been installed so we can't load it because R doesn't have a copy of it.
</div>

## Loading and installing packages {.build}

<div>
**Step 1.** We need to install the package first!

- Install the **fortunes** package using RStudio. 

- Look for the the **fortunes** package is the **Packages** tab again. 

- Try again to use the `fortune` function. 

Does this work or do you see an error?
</div>

<div>
Why doesn't this work? The package has now been installed. However, we forgot to load it.
</div>

## Loading and installing packages {.build}

<div>
**Step 2.** Next, we need to load and attach the package.

- Use `library` to load the **fortunes** package (plural). 

- Try again to use the `fortune` function.
</div>

<div>
That should have worked because the package had been installed **and** we remembered to use `library` load it. What does the `fortune` function do?

```{r}
library(fortunes)
fortune(which = 105)
```

</div>

## Loading and installing packages

<div>
Now try the following:

1. Close down Rstudio completely then open it again.

2. Try to use the `fortune` function. Does this work?

3. Use `library` to load and attach the **fortunes** package.

4. Try to use the `fortune` function. Does this work?
</div>

<div>
You did not have to install the package again to use it. You only had to load it using `library`. Installing is a 'do once' operation. Loading is a 'do every time' operation.
</div>

## Exercise {.small}

In the next few weeks we're going to be using two packages: `dplyr` and `ggplot2`.
The TAs installed these packages on a lot of your computers last week.   
<br>
Check whether they're installed now using the following code:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

If you get an error message (NOT a warning) - stick your hand up.

Getting help | Learning about a function
======================================================================================

## Help files

Do the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?round
```

Help files are really **documentation** files:

- Description
- Usage
- Arguments
- Details
- References
- Examples

Let's step though the help for `round`...

## Exercise {.smaller .build}

<div id="exercise-box">
__Using the help files__
<div id="box-text">

Use the `rep` function to create the following three sequences:
```{r, echo=FALSE}

## What if you don't know the function name?
Do the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??round
```

## Other sources of help {.smaller .build}

The internet is packed full of helpful resources:

- **Google** -- this might be obvious, but you have to work on your "Google-fu" to find what you want. The key is to pick the right search terms:

    - include the function or package name
    
    - include the letter R!
    
    - be selective about which sites you look at...

- **Stack Overflow** -- probably the best question and answer site for computing stuff. People can be a bit blunt though:

    - check whether your question has been asked before (Google)
    
    - read the community guidelines
    
    - provide example code with your questions

## Other sources of help {.build}

**Each other** -- work in groups
  
**The TAs** -- they are really good with R
